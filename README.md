# Design-Pattern Samples in C#

## Design Principles:
1. Single Responsibility
2. Open/Closed
3. Liskov Substitution
4. Interface Segregation
5. Dependency Inversion
6. KISS
7. DRY

## Design-Patterns


### Creational Patterns

* Abstract Factory	Creates an instance of several families of classes
* Builder	Separates object construction from its representation
* Factory Method	Creates an instance of several derived classes
* Prototype	A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
* Singleton	A class of which only a single instance can exist

### Structural Patterns

* Adapter	Match interfaces of different classes
* Bridge	Separates an object’s interface from its implementation
* Composite	A tree structure of simple and composite objects
* Decorator	Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
* Facade	A single class that represents an entire subsystem
* Flyweight	A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
* Proxy	An object representing another object

### Behavioral Patterns

* Chain of Resp.	A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
* Command	Encapsulate a command request as an object
* Interpreter	A way to include language elements in a program
* Iterator	Sequentially access the elements of a collection
* Mediator	Defines simplified communication between classes
* Memento	Capture and restore an object's internal state
* Observer	A way of notifying change to a number of classes
* State	Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
* Strategy	Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
* Template Method	Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
* Visitor	Defines a new operation to a class without change
